   * Give the graphsize/ width and height of the graph[in inches]. NOTE:By default they are 6.4 and 4.8 respectively
   
   * The space for entering the width will be displayed first then enter the height.

    *Example:
          Enter width:12
          Enter height:13
          
   * Enter the X values[min 5 values]
   
    *Example:
   
          input:
          1
          2
          3
          4
          5
          stop #Enter stop for exiting from the loop
    output: [1,2,3,4,5] 
    
   * Now enter the Y values[min 5 values] 
        
    *Example:
    input:
          9
          8
          7

           Name of y axis: Y--axis
           
* Enter your graph's x and y variable-fontsize

          Enter fontsize of y variables: 10
          
* Enter a relevant title for the graph
     
      Example:
          Title: Graph-xyz
          
* Now Enter the degree of rotation of x and y labels of your graph
  
      Example:
           Input: 30
           Output: #The x or y label will rotate 30 degree
        Note: Enter zero for no rotation
